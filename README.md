# Airnb Project Analysis
##Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze the Seattle Airbnb listing dataset and identify the key factors that influence rental pricing and revenue performance. This dashboard helps hosts and investors understand market dynamics, including price sensitivity by location and property size, so businesses can improve listing strategies, target the most profitable segments, and increase annual income.

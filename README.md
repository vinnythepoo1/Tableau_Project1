# Airbnb Project Analysis
## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze the Seattle Airbnb listing dataset and identify the key factors that influence rental pricing and revenue performance. This dashboard helps hosts and investors understand market dynamics, including price sensitivity by location and property size, so businesses can improve listing strategies, target the most profitable segments, and increase annual income.

## Project Insights
- The highest rental prices are found in the low-supply segment of 6-bedroom units, proving that scarcity is the main driver of peak market value.
- Summer is the peak earning season for hosts, with the highest revenue consistently generated in late May and early June.
- Location is key to market value, as central, convenient zip codes like 98119 command premium rental rates.
- The market is oversupplied with small homes, as the dominance of 1-bedroom units creates high competition and pushes down the average price in that segment.
- Large group rentals (4+ bedrooms) are a highly profitable niche, confirming a valuable market that supports very high average prices.
